Items marked with * are important (required to be done first)

General:
-* Remove character parts, sort out head
-* Move camera somewhere

- Build an airport
- Scale down current plane and add engine block etc

Main menu:
- Have camera moving around the map?
- Add random free flight button? Maybe not as free flight pages will have random buttons
- Maybe add a statistics page? Total flight time, flight distance, average speed, most common plane etc. (yay for JSON storage!)

Free flight:
	Picking plane:
	-* Move the camera away from the map
	-* Copy the selected plane (use local parts?) so player can see what his colour scheme is
	- Add randomize button for:
		- Picking random plane
		- Randomizing each colour
	- Maybe add transparency + reflectance settings for each part (perhaps in the model, if findFirstChild("HasTransparency/Reflectance") so plane modeller can specify)
	- Eventually add plane locked/unlocked when missions added

	* Picking airport:
	-* Scrolling frame on left with all airports (like pick plane)
	-* Click airport to expand sub-page with spawn locations in airport
	- When airport click, camera moves to it
	- When spawn location clicked, local marker appears above it to show player where they picked
	- Add randomize buttons
	-* Add fly button
	-* Spawn plane

Missions:
- Scrolling frame of missions (do some shading out/not show if not unlocked)
- Click mission to expand sub-page with in-depth details of mission
- Maybe have personal highscores on certain missions? Like time taken and stuff

ATC:
- Like picking airport, has scrolling frame of airports with current ATC count

Passenger:
- Scrolling frame of all people + their plane
- Click person to move camera to it and follow
- Menu on left folds away when on plane, hover on left (or have a button?) to expand
- When expanded click a different person to go to it
- Pilot gets notified about new passenger

Options:
- Keep this?

Plane flying:
-* Todo on the todo list: think of guis and controls for planes
